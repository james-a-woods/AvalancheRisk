    <string name="threex3_desc">The 3x3 Filter Method is a method developed by Werner Munter for assessing
        aspects contributing to the risk of an avalanche.  It provides three levels of checks for each of the 
        three decision making stages before and while on the mountain.  This application provides a reminder checklist 
        to help you consider important aspects for your decision making.\n\n
        It is important to fully understand each point in this checklist through appropriate training
        and reading.  It is not this checklist that provides the safety, but the understanding of the factors
        behind the checklist.\n\n
        It is a good idea to work on memorising this checklist during the season, especially the zonal aspects.  It is
        not always practical to pull out your phone and work through this checklist while making decisions
        on the mountain.  This is especially the case in extreme conditions where you may need to make fast decisions
        adapting to changing conditions.</string>
