    <string name="asIs">This application is provided as is.\nYour safety is your own responsibility.</string>
    <string name="disclaimer">This is a tool for assisting with the calculation of avalanche risk using the Reduction Method developed by Werner Munter.  This is in no way a replacement for training and experience in the assessment of avalanche danger.  The use of this application must be used together with an assessment of local conditions and route choices using the 3x3 method.  If in doubt, hire a qualified mountain guide.</string>
    <string name="noSnowMobiles">Not for use with Snowmobiles</string>
    <string name="whyNoSnowMobiles">Snowmobiles put extra load on the snow pack and can trigger an avalanche in conditions where a skier or snowboarder would be safe.</string>
